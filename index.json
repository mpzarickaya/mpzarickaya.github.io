Despite the approaching school semester, I decided to dedicate this time to not only relaxing, but also preparing for my upcoming classes.\nNew Technologies I spent most of the week on the computer learning about new technologies. I decided to refresh my knowledge of Python and experimented with a couple of small projects. Also started learning the basics of Flask - I want to try to create a small web application in the new semester.\nVacation with friends But, of course, I didn’t forget about a full vacation. I met up with some friends and we spent a couple of days in nature, enjoying the last warm days.\nReady for the new school year Now, rested and full of energy, I am ready for the new school year. Although I am a little sad that the vacation is over, I am optimistic about the future - there is so much new knowledge and interesting tasks ahead!\n","date":1724544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724544000,"objectID":"db38d7484ed51cb449d14d71c2837e78","permalink":"https://example.com/post/prevweek/","publishdate":"2024-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/prevweek/","section":"post","summary":"Getting ready for studying","tags":["Academic"],"title":"What happened last week?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zaritskaya Marina"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Version control with Git: the foundation of efficient development In the world of software development, version control is one of the key processes that helps you manage code changes, work as a team, and keep your project up to date. Git is one of the most popular tools for version control, and its use has become an industry standard.\nWhy version control? Version control allows you to keep track of every change to your project, whether it’s adding new functionality, fixing a bug, or just doing a little code refactoring. With Git, you can go back to any previous version of your project, compare changes, roll back in case of errors, and work on multiple versions of your project in parallel.\nGit’s main features Git provides a wide range of features, including:\nCreating and working with branches. Branches allow you to isolate work on individual tasks, which is especially useful in team development. Merging changes. When work on a branch is complete, you can easily merge it with the main branch (master or main) without losing any data. View change history. Git keeps a detailed history of every commit, so you can track who made what changes to your code, when, and how. Teamwork. Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project, synchronizing changes and resolving code conflicts. Why is Git so popular? Git has gained popularity because of its flexibility, speed, and ability to work both locally and with remote repositories. It is also supported by many hosting services such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, which offer additional features for teamwork, automation, and integration with other tools.\nSummarizing Mastering Git is a must-have skill for any developer. This tool not only simplifies project management, but also allows you to organize effective teamwork, minimizing the risk of data loss and simplifying the development process. You can start using Git today, and the sooner you do, the sooner you will be able to experience all its benefits.\n","date":1720828800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724544000,"objectID":"3104a213520afd4e0aad3f5b75bc39df","permalink":"https://example.com/post/github/","publishdate":"2024-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/github/","section":"post","summary":"This post is about how to get started with Git.
